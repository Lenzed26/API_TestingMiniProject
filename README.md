# API_TestingMiniProject

## Project Description

We will be using the Rick and Morty API using  a scrum framework, which covers unit tests to test the API responses and request using RestSharp. As a team, we used GitHub as our Control Version System.

## Project Goals
- The aim of the project was to show our understandings of API's and develop a test framework for an API of our choice. 
  The project was considered finished when we accomplished all our user stories and had created appropriate tests for all of them. With this in mind our main goals were (from the brief) were as follows:

  - Create a test framework for a chosen API that tests all data in the RESPONSE and tests at least 3 requests.

  - A complete Kanban board to document the process 

  - Detailed Readme explaining how to use the framework

#### Sprint Review

In sprint 1, We were able to get test the Rick and Morty API which consisted of three categories "**Characters**", "**Locations**" and "**Episodes**". As a team we were able to create tests for both sad and happy paths for single and bulk results. We had a blocker dealing with generic classes with the type being an error and after debugging we were to resolve it in good time.

#### Sprint Retrospective

As a team, we are communication with the team on the user cases to allocate testing to individual. We were able to use Git pull requests and learn more about how the process worked as a team. 

### Sprint 2

#### Sprint Review

For sprint 2, In this sprint we checked if the names it pulls give a list of id's and we are trying to pull a list of ids, we also focused to add some more tests to cover sad paths. We also worked on the README.md to organise all our sprint goals and instructions to download any NuGet packages if the project has to be downloaded from GitHub.

#### Step 1:

Once you have opened the Project in Visual Studio if the packages haven't been automatically installed you must first do this:

1. Open the APIClient and right click on Dependencies and click on manage Nuget packages.
2. From here click on browse and search for "Newtonsoft.Json", "NUnit", "NUnit3TestAdapter", "RestSharp", "System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager", "System.Security.AccessControl", "System.Security.Permissions" and "System.Security.Principal.Windows" install both of these packages.
